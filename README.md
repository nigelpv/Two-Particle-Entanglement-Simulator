# Two Particle Entanglement Simulator

A polished, exhibition-quality interactive experience allowing users to explore quantum entanglement. This project is designed as a digital exhibit, visualizing Bell's inequalities and quantum correlations in an accessible, aesthetic way.

## Features

- **Interactive State Selection**: Choose from predefined quantum states or customize angles.
- **Visual Correlation**: Real-time visualization of particle spin correlations.
- **Bell Test**: Run experiments to see violations of Bell's inequalities.
- **Educational Mode**: Learn about the physics behind the simulation.
